# LibreVoiceAI

## Description

LibreVoiceAI aims to democratize decision-making by facilitating the democratic method of discourse among participants. This project leverages Language Learning Models (LLMs) to enable a faster, more inclusive, and transparent way of reaching consensus. The LLM serves a neutral role, acting solely as a facilitator and translator to help all voices be heard and understood.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Enables participants to communicate in their native languages.
- **Neutral Facilitation**: Utilizes LLMs to provide an unbiased environment for discussion.
- **Graphical Representations**: Uses tools like Graphviz to visualize the discourse and decision-making processes.
- **Data Analysis**: Incorporates common Python tooling for real-time data analysis and understanding.

## Target Audiences

1. Individuals and organizations committed to making decision-making more inclusive and democratic.
2. The open-source community, particularly those interested in leveraging AI for social impact.

## Requirements

There is no intrinsic choice for language or platform; such decisions will be a matter of consensus among the community.

## Getting Started

- **Initial Setup**: This project is in its nascent stage, and you're invited to help shape its future. The repository will be available for cloning once it's set up.
- **Participation**: We believe that consensus is key and we need insights and support from everyone. When the project is active, participants will be able to connect using any SSL method and communicate via any API.

Your involvement can make a real difference. We're particularly interested in gathering a diverse range of perspectives to make the decision-making process as inclusive and democratic as possible.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcomed from everyone. Fork the repository and create a pull request to propose your changes.

## Roadmap

- Integrate data analysis tools for enhanced decision-making.
- Build an easy-to-use UI for less tech-savvy participants.
